                The second SwInBee was held on Thursday, September 19,
                2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                Congratulation to Dang Nhat Minh Phan, who was the overall winnner! 
                </p><p>
                <!--Check names of actual participants-->
                Many thanks to Minh, Ricky, Jingyi, Methsala, Oli,
                Afnan, and Van for participating, and making the event a
                success. Your enthusiasm makes all the difference, and
                makes it well and truly worth the effort of the
                organisers (Fede and Nathan).
                </p><p>
                The qualifying round was closely fought, with Jingyi
                getting a fabulous top score of 15/20. (Aside: I'm
                pretty sure this is better than I - Nathan - could have
                achieved under time pressure.)
                The top three were Jingyi, Minh, and Van, with Methsala
                and Afnan getting equal fourth.
                </p><p>
                We then had a bit of a break and some drinks and
                nibbles, while Nathan got to work marking the
                competition papers.
                </p><p>
                After the break we headed back to EN615 for the
                on-the-board competitions to determine the prize
                winners, starting with an on-the-board knock-out integral to determine
                4th place, with Methsala winning, and Afnan in unlucky
                5th place (but an excellent sport about it).
                </p><p>
                Then we had our number 2 and 3 seeds facing off in our
                first on-the-board semi-final, with Minh beating Van. 
                </p><p>
                Then we had our number 1 and 4 seeds facing off in our
                second semi-final, with Methsala causing an upset
                (according to the seedings!) over Jingyi. 
                </p><p>
                Next, in the competition for 3rd and 4th place, Jingyi
                beat Van.
                </p><p>
                Finally, in a closely fought final Minh beat Methsala to
                take the &ldquo;Champion Integrator&rdquo; prize!
                </p><p>
                The attitude of all competitors was really positive. One
                particularly pleasing aspect (pointed out by Jingyi) was
                that this year we had 3 out of 4 prize winners being
                women.
