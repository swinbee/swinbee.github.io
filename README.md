# Swinburne Integration Bee (SwInBee)

An integration bee is a mathematical competition focussed on integral calculus. After a qualifying round, competitors challenge each other at being the fastest and most accurate integrator, in the same vein as spelling bees. One of the most celebrated and popular integration bees in the world is that of Massachussets Institute of Technology. It was held for the first time in 1981.

SwInBee is run and managed by the Department of Mathematics and is open to all undergraduate students at Swinburne.

Can you evaluate integrals like these?
<p>
$$\int \frac{7x-2}{(1+x)(1+x^2)} \; dx$$
$$\int \sin^7x \cos x \; dx$$
$$\int e^{-3x} \sin \frac{x}{2} \;  dx$$
$$\int (\cos x \cosh x + \sin x \sinh x) \; dx$$
</p>

If yes, then **SwInBee** needs **you**!

The second annual SwInBee will be held during the teaching free week in September, 2019, on Thursday September 19\.

You can get a sense of what is involved by looking at the past questions and solutions below.

If you are interested in participating please contact either Fede or Nathan (details below) to be added to the mailing list.

## When and where

The second SwInBee will be held from 10am-12pm on Thursday, September 19, 2019, in EN615, Hawthorn campus.

## Registration

The deadline for registration is Monday, September 16 at 5 pm. Please email either Fede or Nathan to register.

Dr Nathan Clisby ([nclisby@swin.edu.au](mailto:nclisby@swin.edu.au))

Dr Federico Frascoli ([ffrascoli@swin.edu.au](mailto:ffrascoli@swin.edu.au)).

## Rules and Schedule

The qualifier round lasts 60 minutes and consists of a paper of 20 integrals of various difficulties. Workings do not attract any mark. No books or calculators are allowed.

After the qualifier round, there will be a break for 30 minutes, with refreshments provided. The best 4 participants in the qualifier round will then go "head-to-head" on the whiteboard to decide who is the Queen or King Integrator!

## Prizes

First Prize: Queen/King Integrator Title + $200

Second Prize: $150

Third Prize: $100

Fourth Prize: $50

## Results for 2019!

The second SwInBee was held on Thursday, September 19, 2019.

Congratulation to Dang Nhat Minh Phan, who was the overall winnner!

Many thanks to Minh, Ricky, Jingyi, Methsala, Oli, Afnan, and Van for participating, and making the event a success. Your enthusiasm makes all the difference, and makes it well and truly worth the effort of the organisers (Fede and Nathan).

The qualifying round was closely fought, with Jingyi getting a fabulous top score of 15/20\. (Aside: I'm pretty sure this is better than I - Nathan - could have achieved under time pressure.) The top three were Jingyi, Minh, and Van, with Methsala and Afnan getting equal fourth.

We then had a bit of a break and some drinks and nibbles, while Nathan got to work marking the competition papers.

After the break we headed back to EN615 for the on-the-board competitions to determine the prize winners, starting with an on-the-board knock-out integral to determine 4th place, with Methsala winning, and Afnan in unlucky 5th place (but an excellent sport about it).

Then we had our number 2 and 3 seeds facing off in our first on-the-board semi-final, with Minh beating Van.

Then we had our number 1 and 4 seeds facing off in our second semi-final, with Methsala causing an upset (according to the seedings!) over Jingyi.

Next, in the competition for 3rd and 4th place, Jingyi beat Van.

Finally, in a closely fought final Minh beat Methsala to take the “King Integrator” prize!

The attitude of all competitors was really positive. One particularly pleasing aspect (pointed out by Jingyi) was that this year we had 3 out of 4 prize winners being women.
