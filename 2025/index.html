                Congratulations to Alex Herman, who was the overall winner!

                <!--Check names of actual participants-->
                Many thanks to 
                Minh An Nguyen, Alex Herman, Bao Pham, 
                Khoi Nguyen Pham,
                Nguyen Duc Thang,
                Thi Thu Hang Nguyen,
                and
                Sebastian Stevenson
                for participating, Mel Miles and James Evans for spectating,
                and to maths department staff who attended and helped out with
                preparation and marking, especially Billy Todd and Louise
                Olsen-Kettle.
                The
                event was held in a really supportive atmosphere with a lot of enthusiasm for
                maths. 
                </p><p>
                In the end the person named
                Champion Integrator was Alex Herman who received a $200 prize, runner
                up was Minh An Nguyen ($150), third place Bao Pham ($100), and fourth
                place Sebastian Stevenson ($50). 
                </p><p>
                Remarkably, the top three prize winners repeated their efforts
                from 2024.
                </p><p>
                And, this year was notable for how even the qualifying round
                was: we had two students finish equal second, and then three
                students finished equal fourth, necessitating a sudden death
                integral-off to determine who would reach the final (Bao, who
                has nerves of steel, made it through).
                </p><p>
                You can download the pdf files for the qualifying round <a
                    href="/pdf/swinbee2025questions.pdf">questions</a> and <a
                        href="/pdf/swinbee2025solutions.pdf">questions
                        with solutions</a>. If you'd really like a
                    worked solution for any of these integrals please
                    contact Nathan.
