# Swinburne Integration Bee (SwInBee) 2018

The first SwInBee was held on Friday, September 14, 2018.

Congratulation to Chuong Ho, who was the overall winnner!

Many thanks to Anh, Chuong, Dmytro, Jordan, Joshua, Kyle, Max, Meriem, Nicola, Oliver, Reece, Stuart, and Stuart for participating. We hope that this will be the start of a long tradition at Swinburne, and your enthusiasm made this first one a big success.

All four finalists performed very well in the qualifying round, and then competed head to head on the whiteboard, in four closely fought battles (two semi-finals, then play-offs for first vs second, and then third vs fourth).
